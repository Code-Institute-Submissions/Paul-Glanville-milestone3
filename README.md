### Testing

had an issue while testing the page I was unable to click on the login and register buttons properly, after adding into the script.js i was able to click the nav functions and they functioned as expected.
originally when trying to load the page it wouldn't function, after a brief discussion and check over the app.py noticed that i had made minor spelling mistake for the functions and route, But have corrected and now runs when needed.
